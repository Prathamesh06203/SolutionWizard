                <span><!-- line here --></span>
                <p>Our website that would avail a number of calculators 
                    like molarity, standard solution for a wide range of 
                    compounds/elements which would be hoping to help 
                    many professionals like teachers, students and even 
                    people outside this field that might want to deal with 
                    solutions. The user could use the features easily by 
                    visiting the website and clicking on the calculators to 
                    open them. Then all they need to do is to simply enter 
                    the known quantity of the concerned materials and 
                    then the algorithm would calculate required amount 
                    of materials required to prepare a specific solution. 
                    It also has provides a very useful feature that would 
                    automatically enter the chemical formula of the given 
                    compound that will make it convenient for people 
                    from outside the chemistry field to make use of our 
                    features.</p>
